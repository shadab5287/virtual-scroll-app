### **Implementation Overview**

The Angular application implements a virtual scrolling feature with the ability to toggle between two views: 'table' and 'card'. The primary components involved are:

1. **AppComponent (Parent Component)**: Manages the overall state, including the list of items, loading status, and active view. It handles the initial data loading and responds to the child components' requests for more data.

2. **ScrollCardComponent (Child Component)**: Displays items in a card layout using virtual scrolling. It monitors scroll events and emits a signal to the parent component when more data needs to be loaded.

3. **VirtualScrollComponent (Child Component)**: Displays items in a table layout using virtual scrolling. It monitors scroll events and emits a signal to the parent component when more data needs to be loaded.

### **Architectural Choices**

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented using Angular's `CdkVirtualScrollViewport` to efficiently handle large datasets by only rendering the items that are currently visible. This improves performance, especially for mobile devices.

2. **Toggle Between Views**: The application allows users to toggle between 'table' and 'card' views. When toggling, the data is reset to ensure that items load from the beginning. This is done by resetting the `items` array and `itemCount` in the parent component.

3. **Data Handling**: The parent component is responsible for loading data and managing the overall application state. This ensures that the child components remain focused on presentation logic. Data loading is triggered both initially and when the child component emits a scroll event.

### **How to Run and Test the Solution**

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js version `14.21.3` installed.
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Use `ng serve` to start the development server.
   - Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser to view the application.

3. **Testing the Solution**:
   - Toggle between 'table' and 'card' views using the buttons provided.
   - Scroll down in each view to trigger data loading.
   - Verify that data resets and loads from the beginning when switching views.
   - Use the browser's developer tools to simulate mobile devices and check the responsiveness and performance.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The `resetData()` method is called when toggling views to reset the item list and reload data.
   - Scroll events are handled with debouncing to prevent excessive calls during rapid scrolling.
   - The `getDynamicThreshold()` method adjusts the threshold for loading more items based on the viewport height, optimizing for both desktop and mobile.

By following this structure, the solution maintains a clean separation of concerns, with the parent component managing state and data, while the child components focus on displaying the data efficiently.
